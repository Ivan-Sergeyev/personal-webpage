<!-- I am a versatile researcher currently working in theoretical computer science. My background is very diverse and I use it to my advantage, utilizing mathematical rigor, physical intuition, and programming experience to push my research forward. -->
I am an interdisciplinary researcher who focuses on solving theoretical problems strongly motivated by real-world applications. I have extensive background in theoretical physics, pure and applied mathematics, and computer science. I like to use various methods from different fields to get new insights and make progress in my research.

Currently, I am a postdoc in Prof. Vladimir Kolmogorov's group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. My main research project is concerned with maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in Markov random fields (MRF). Additionally, I dabble in formal theorem verification in Lean.
